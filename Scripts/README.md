# Healthcare Cost Analysis and Prediction

## Project overview 
This document provides an in-depth overview of the project, “HealthCare Cost Analysis and Prediction”, which aims to analyze and predict individual medical costs based on personal and health-related factors using dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset comprises columns such as Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, and Charges.

## Motivation
The rising costs of healthcare in the US make it crucial to understand and predict medical expenses. This project addresses this concern by providing insights and predictive capabilities.

## Goal
The goal is to analyze and predict individual medical costs (charges) based on personal and health-related factors to better understand healthcare expenses and develop a predictive model for future cost estimation.

## Objectives
    • Develop a predictive model to estimate individual medical costs based on personal and health-related factors.
    • Provide insights into the factors that significantly impact medical costs.
    • Create a user-friendly interface for data exploration and cost predictions.
    • Ensure the highest standards of data privacy and security in handling personal healthcare data.

## Key Questions
What factors significantly impact medical costs?
Is there a difference in charges among different regions?
How are medical costs (charges) distributed?
How is gender distributed among insured individuals?
What is the distribution of MBI values, and how many people have a BMI within the healthy range (18.5-24.9)?
How many children do most individuals have covered by health insurance?
What is the proportion of smokers/nonsmokers?
What is the distribution of ages over the study period?

## Assumptions and Constraints
The accuracy of cost predictions may be limited by the available data.
The model assumes that historical data accurately represents future trends in healthcare costs.

## Predictive Analysis Method
Regression analysis will be utilized, including linear regression and decision tree regression. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed to better understand the dataset, visualize distributions, correlations, and outliers, and help inform the predictive modeling approach.

## Data Source
The healthcare data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, a reputable platform known for hosting datasets and machine learning competitions.

## Data Collection Method
The data can be categorized as administrative data, likely originating from administrative records of healthcare providers or insurance companies.

## Data profile
The dataset includes variables such as Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, and Charges. Data consistency is maintained, with 1,338 records for each variables.

## Define questions to explore.
Factors impacting healthcare charges.
How does age influence healthcare charges?
Do smokers tend to have higher healthcare charges compared to non-smokers?
Are there regional variations in healthcare charges?

## Relationship between healthcare cost distribution and number of children covered.
Is there a correlation between number of children and healthcare charges?
Do individuals with more children tend to have higher or lower healthcare costs?

## Relationship between BMI and Healthcare Charges.
Are individuals with higher BMI likely to have higher healthcare charges?
Is there a difference in healthcare costs based on BMI categories (underweight, normal, weight, overweight, obese)?
